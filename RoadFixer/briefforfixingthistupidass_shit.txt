rem make sure we're in the p: drive
code

from dayz - extract binarised roads to p:\dz\data\structures\roads_bin
from github - download and extract unbinarised roads to p:\dz\data\structures\roads

have a pre-build button that renames the folders so mikeros can copy the binarised roads from p:\z\..\roads to temp
then maybe have a tag in the folder bin /unbin that the app an check for and display a status
