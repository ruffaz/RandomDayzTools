This is fairly unstable working code. Use at your own risk. 

The most up to date and usable tool is dayzmodloader. Head to the release page to use the production binary.

## LightingConfigurator
WIP attempt to make a rudimentary UI for the lighting configs Dayz uses

## Pdrive mapper
A utility to map any folder to a p: drive. Based off a tool I wrote for production use. Heavily battle tested in a busy game studio!
Writes registry entries and is easily configurable.

## Roadfixer
