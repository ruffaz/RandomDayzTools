## DayzModLoader - stable

|Local painless mod loader 
|---
|server only  - use the dayz launcher to find and load your mods automatically
|dayzdiag as client/server - painless option
|client only - this only works for DayzEditor, as the DayzClient does not run without BattleEye

### Basic workflow - 
Select mod folders from either the steam workshop location, or your local dev environment (usually p: drive). The program will create a corresponding junction in DayzServer, and load the server with flags you specify.
